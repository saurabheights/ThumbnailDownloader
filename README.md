# ThumbnailDownloader - (Under Construction)
Download thumbnail from popular video-hosting websites. Simple enough.

**This library is built as a feature of the UniversalImageLib. Use of modules will allow users to pay(in memory used) only for what is needed.**

## Roadmap
1. Add Vimeo Thumbnail Downloader.
2. Add Test for each platform. Do a through analysis and apply any finishing touches.
3. Add to maven and build a release on github.
4. Update the Github Readme document.
